## About

This repo contains source code (LaTeX) for my resume.
It's continuously integrated and deployed using GitHub Actions.
It uses ImageMagick's [`convert`](https://imagemagick.org/script/convert.php) function to convert from pdf to jpg and display it [below](#preview).
It's linted using [`chktex`](https://www.nongnu.org/chktex/).

It's a template, so that you can generate your own resume using this format.
The LaTeX source code is licensed under the GNU AGPL licesnse.
