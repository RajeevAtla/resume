## About

This repo contains source code ([Typst](https://typst.app/docs/)) for my resume.
It's continuously integrated and deployed using GitHub Actions and is recompiled on push (see above for workflow status).
It's linted using [`typstyle`](https://typstyle-rs.github.io/typstyle/).

It's a template, so that you can generate your own resume using this format.
The Typst source code is licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit).

## Inspiration

This resume template was inspired by [Jake's Resume](https://github.com/jakegut/resume).
